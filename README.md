> _‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how it worked. I just knew it would.‚Äù_

CypherGate is a Bash-powered VPN tunneling script that:
- Fetches live VPN server lists from [VPNGate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/)
- Auto-patches broken OpenVPN configs (fixes cipher issues automagically)
- Lets you select servers via a terminal-based UI (whiptail)
- Connects automatically through OpenVPN
- Caches server lists for offline use
- Logs everything for your ~paranoia~ convenience
- Sends desktop notifications for each step

Born purely out of spite for broken configs and a desire to automate everything.
