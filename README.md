# CypherGate

**Autonomous VPN tunneling app. Fetches, patches, connects.**

> _‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how it worked. I just knew it would.‚Äù_

CypherGate is a fully autonomous VPN tunneling app featuring:
- Live VPN server fetching from [VPNGate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/)
- Auto-patches broken OpenVPN configs (fixes cipher issues automagically)
- Modern **Qt GUI** *(with system tray support, notifications, etc.)*
- Minimalist terminal-based legacy TUI (for old-school vibes)
- Auto-connect, manual connect, and fastest-server modes
- Caches server lists for offline use
- Logs every connection for your ~paranoia~ convenience
- Desktop notifications for each step (both GUI & TUI)

Born purely out of spite for broken configs and a desire to automate everything.
